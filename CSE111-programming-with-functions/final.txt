Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.

The functions are a strong instrument to build programs organized and reutilizeble. This week I helped a friend who is studying C, I was shocked to realize that C do not have objects!  Imagine what would be python without functions? A big maze of variables and loops.



2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?

Test functions help us to code clear and prepare our program to be refacted in the future, they also help us to test our code, see problems and fix them.


3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?

First I run the program, then see the error message and search on the internet for the cause and a possible solution, When I feel really lost I ask for an AI to explain the code to me, but I do not like to ask for it to write the code, most of the time the AI make the code even more confused, I try to understand the logic and start to make tests in small junks of code if it works then I pass to the program with the problem. Maybe I lost too much time to understand the problem, I could fix everything using functions already done on the internet.
